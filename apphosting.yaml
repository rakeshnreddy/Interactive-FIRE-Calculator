service: default # 'default' is typical for your main backend

backend:
  # The 'path' points to the directory relative to your repo root
  # that contains your backend code and Dockerfile.
  path: project/
  # App Hosting will automatically look for a Dockerfile in this path
  # to build your backend image.

frontend:
  # The 'path' points to the directory relative to your repo root
  # that contains your static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
  # App Hosting will serve these files directly.
  path: project/static/

# You can also configure resource limits here, like CPU and memory,
# but default settings are often fine to start.
# resources:
#   cpu: 1
#   memory: 512Mi
